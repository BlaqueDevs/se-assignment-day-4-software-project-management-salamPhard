#SOLUTION
1.	
Timely delivery refers to the delivery of software project at the required time. Every project has its cycle and in the planning stage, Its pertinent to set timelines for the beginning of the project, each sprint and when deliverable will be delivered. It brings satisfaction to the client. Project manager hence can re-adjust schedule, prioritize what is importance in order to ensure deadlines are met.
2.	
For every project, a budget is hence needed to be set to achieve success in the project. Effective cost control refers to controlling expenses due to software project by the developer’s team.  Project managers can prevent over running of already planned budget by sticking to plan and politely say no when necessary. Make sure you do:
a.	Detailed project planning
b.	Accurate or very close to accurate cost estimation
c.	Scope Management
d.	Effective Resource management
e.	Regular Budget Tracking and Forecasting
3.	Water fall is like a linear flow. It means one step finishes before the next starts. It’s a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. 
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach that focuses on flexibility, collaboration and continuous improvement. 
Advantages 
a.	Water fall has a clear structure with well-defined phases
b.	Easier to manage and track progress
c.	Works well for projects with fixed budgets and timelines
Agile:
a.	Highly adaptive to changing requirement
b.	Continous feedback ensures better alignment with user needs
c.	Faster time-to-market with incremental releases
Disadvantages
a. Difficult to accommodate changes once development starts
b. Late discovery of defects increases rework cost
c. Customers see the final products only at the end

Agile:
a.	Requires significant customer involvement
b.	Difficult to estimate time and cost upfront
c. 	Can lead to scope creep without proper control 	
4.	Agile is more beneficial than waterfall in a project with highly adaptive changing requirement. Where requirements are uncertain or expected to evolve and not well-defined. For example a mobile E-commerce App. It has an unclear or evolving requirement has user preferences and market trends change rapidly. In this type of project, there is always a frequent customer involvement. Also an incremental releases is also needed. Hence Agile plays a more beneficial role to be used than waterfall.
5.	Ensuring software quality requires continuous monitoring, testing, and adherence to best practices throughout the development lifecycle. Below are the key methods:
i.	Defining clear quality standard: ISO 9001 
j.	Implement a strong testing strategy
k.	Adopt continuous integration and continuous deployment
l.	Do code reviews and pair programming
m.	Monitor and improve with your QA metrics
It is important to maintain highs standards as its also help the software projects become standard while presenting to the client.


6.	
Defining project scope means setting the limit or boundaries for the project by listing deliverables and objectives. A WBS is a project management tool that breaks down a complex project into smaller, manageable tasks or deliverables. It represents the hierarchical decomposition of work that needs to be completed, making it easier to plan, track and manage.
7.	It helps to develop a detailed timeline with milestones. Gantt charts visually map out start and end dates for each task, hence helps in breaking down complex projects into smaller, manageable tasks.
8.	NomaConnect is a smart farming and Market Linkage Application. Rural farmers face challenges such as limited access to market prices, lack of modern farming techniques, unpredicted weather conditions and difficulty selling their produce at fair price. NomaConnect is a software solution that connects farmers to markets, weather forecasts and agricultural experts which will significantly improve their productivity and income.
9.	Clearly defining the problem allows quick solution to the project goals. It allows you know where the project is coming from and where it ends. Its gives actual understand of what the software solution is going to be made for.
10.	
Increase market price, weather forecast, farming tips and expert’s ideas, government & NGO support is really needed for local farmers. The software solution is needed to be able to solve the problem. It allows market price trend increase to be gotten in real terms, APIs for weather forecast help farmers to the what the weather will be in other to plan for planting and harvesting e.t.c
11.	-	NomaConnect works is a cross platform software. 
-	It will be in local languages so that most local farmers can understand what and what of the software
-	It’s an affordable software so that all farmers will be able to afford the purchase

Global connected agriculture market = USD 1.84 billion in 2018
Projected global connected agriculture market = USD 7.22 billion in 2026
Exhibiting a compound annual growth rate = 19.1%
Also in another report
Global connected agriculture market = USD 5.90 billion in 2028
Projected global connected agriculture market will exhibiting a compound annual growth rate = 21.48% between 2023 and 2028.
This growth is driven by the adoption of advanced farming technologies such as automated irrigation systems and precision farming techniques.

Agribusiness Market reached USD 3.4 trillion in 2024 and expected to reach USD 4.4 trillion by 2033, exhibiting a CAGR of 2.77% during the period of 2025 and 2033.

Digital Agriculture Market was valued at over USD 22 billion in 2023 and is estimated to register a CAGR of over 11% between 2024 and 2032.
 
13.	
Understanding these trends, NomaConnect operates within a rapidly expanding market with significant growth potential. The increasing adoption of digital technologies in agriculture, the emphasis on sustainable practices and the need for efficient supply chain solutions present substantial opportunities for platforms like NomaConnect to thrive and contribute to the agricultural sector’s modernization.
